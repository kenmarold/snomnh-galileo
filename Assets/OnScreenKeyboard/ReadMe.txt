Heathen Engineering's On Screen Keyboard (OSK)
v2.0.0.0b

Notes:
This version introduces a number of changes to the scripts and supports multiple versions of the tool installed at the same time. In particular the scripts have
been moved into namespaces such as HeathenEngineering.OSK.v1 and HeathenEngineering.OSK.v2; this is to allow the v1 variant to support pre Unity 4.6 environments
while the v2 variant requires unity 4.6 or later do to the use of UnityEngine.UI namespace.

Important:
If you are upgrading it is recomened that you first remove the previous install as changes made may conflict.

For thouse working on Unity 4.5.x or earlier please import the OnScreenKeyboard v1 package and remove the OnScreenKeyboard/v2.x folder as v2.x requires Unity 4.6 and later.
